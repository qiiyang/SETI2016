The top level folders are named after each team members.

Under the "Q. I. Yang" folder there are a few subfolders. The "05. Spark" contains the final version of the distributed algorithm implemented on the IBM Spark platform, including two identical versions with Python and iPython Notebook formats respectively. The rest of the subfolders contain codes for local implementations, including local experimentation, misclassification rate optimizations, etc.

Under the "R. Setra" folder there is currently a single file, which is the Matlab implementation of Rafael's algorithm based on Fisher vectors.
